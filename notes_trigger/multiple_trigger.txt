# this will work on MySQL version 5.7.2+. Older version will not support.

# In case of multiple triggers for the same event in a table, MySQL will invoke the triggers in the order that they were created.

# To change the invoke order of triggers, you need to specify FOLLOWS or PROCEEDS after the FOR EACH ROW clause.
    - Ex:
        DELIMITER $$
        CREATE TRIGGER  trigger_name
        [BEFORE|AFTER] [INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE] ON table_name
        FOR EACH ROW [FOLLOWS|PRECEDES] existing_trigger_name
        BEGIN
        â€¦
        END$$
        DELIMITER ;

# MySql multiple triggers example:
    - http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-triggers/create-multiple-triggers-for-the-same-trigger-event-and-action-time/

# Information On Triggers Order:
    - SHOW TRIGGERS FROM schema_name; // it will not show the order that trigger activate for the same event and action.
    - To find order of trigger activation:
        SELECT
            trigger_name, action_order
        FROM
            information_schema.triggers
        WHERE
            trigger_schema = 'schema_name'
        ORDER BY event_object_table ,
                 action_timing ,
                 event_manipulation
