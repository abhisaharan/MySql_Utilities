# MySQL triggers cannot:

   - Use SHOW, LOAD DATA, LOAD TABLE, BACKUP DATABASE, RESTORE, FLUSH and RETURN statements.
   - Use statements that commit or rollback implicitly or explicitly such as COMMIT , ROLLBACK , START TRANSACTION , LOCK/UNLOCK TABLES , ALTER , CREATE , DROP ,  RENAME.
   - Use prepared statements such as PREPARE and EXECUTE.
   - Use dynamic SQL statements.

From MySQL version 5.1.4, a trigger can call a stored procedure or stored function, which was a limitation is the previous versions.
