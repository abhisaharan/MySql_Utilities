# You must use a unique name for each trigger associated with a table. However, you can have the same trigger name defined for different tables though it is a good practice.

- you should use the following naming convention:
        - (BEFORE | AFTER)_tableName_(INSERT| UPDATE | DELETE)
            or
        - tablename_(BEFORE | AFTER)_(INSERT| UPDATE | DELETE)

            - Ex: For example, "before_order_update" is a trigger invoked before a row in the order table is updated or "order_before_update".
