 # MySql triggers are stored in data directory eg /data/classicmodels/ with the files named tablename.TRG and triggername.TRN
    - tablename.TRG file maps the trigger to the corresponding table.
    - triggername.TRN file contains the trigger definition.

 # we can backup the MySql triggers by copying the trigger files to the backup folder or we can use the mysql dump tool.
