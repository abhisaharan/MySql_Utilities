# this will work on MySQL version 5.7.2+. Older version will not support.

# In case of multiple triggers for the same event in a table, MySQL will invoke the triggers in the order that they were created.

# To change the invoke order of triggers, you need to specify FOLLOWS or PROCEEDS after the FOR EACH ROW clause.
    - Ex:
        DELIMITER $$
        CREATE TRIGGER  trigger_name
        [BEFORE|AFTER] [INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE] ON table_name
        FOR EACH ROW [FOLLOWS|PRECEDES] existing_trigger_name
        BEGIN
        â€¦
        END$$
        DELIMITER ;
