# To declare a variable use the DECLARE statement.
    - DECLARE variable_name datatype(size) DEFAULT default_value;
        - Ex: DECLARE total_sale INT DEFAULT 0;
                or
              DECLARE x, y INT DEFAULT 0; // 2 variable created together with same data type.
        - initial value of variable is NULL.
# To assign variable use SET:
    DECLARE total_count INT DEFAULT 0;
    SET total_count = 10;

# SELECT INTO: assign the result of a query, which returns a scalar value, to a variable
    - DECLARE total_products INT DEFAULT 0;
      SELECT
         COUNT(*) INTO total_products   // assign the total_products  variable the number of products that we selected from the products
      FROM
         products;

# Variable scope:
    - If you declare a variable inside a stored procedure, it will be out of scope when the END statement of stored procedure reaches.
    - If you declare a variable inside BEGIN END  block, it will be out of scope if the END is reached.
    - A variable whose name begins with the @ sign is a session variable. It is available and accessible until the session ends.
