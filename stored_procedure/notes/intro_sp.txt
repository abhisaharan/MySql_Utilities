# a stored procedure is a segment of declarative sql statements. A stored procedure that call itself is known as a recursive stored procedure. Mysql doesn't support it very well.

- adv of sp:
    - Once created, stored procedures are compiled and stored in the database. After compiling a stored procedure, MySQL puts it into a cache and maintains its own stored procedure cache for every single connection. If an application uses a stored procedure multiple times in a single connection, the compiled version is used, otherwise, the stored procedure works like a query.
    - stored procedures help increase the performance of the applications.

- diadv of sp:
    - If you use many stored procedures, the memory usage of every connection that is using those stored procedures will increase substantially. The CPU usage will increase.

# creating MySQL stored procedure:
    - The GetAllProducts()  stored procedure selects all products from the products  table. we put "()" after the name of the stored procedure.
        DELIMITER //
         CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllProducts()
           BEGIN
           SELECT *  FROM products;
           END //
         DELIMITER ;

         - The first command is DELIMITER // , which is not related to the stored procedure syntax. The DELIMITER statement changes the standard delimiter which is semicolon ( ; ) to another. In this case, the delimiter is changed from the semicolon( ; ) to double-slashes //. Why do we have to change the delimiter? Because we want to pass the stored procedure to the server as a whole rather than letting mysql tool interpret each statement at a time.  Following the END keyword, we use the delimiter //  to indicate the end of the stored procedure. The last command ( DELIMITER; ) changes the delimiter back to the semicolon (;).

# calling a stored procedure:
    - CALL stored_procedure_name(); Ex: CALL GetAllProducts();

# Listing stored procedures in a MySQL db:
    - Displaying characteristics of stored procedures
        - SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr];  // only SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS to list all stored procedures.
        - SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE db = 'classicmodels';
        - SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE name LIKE '%product%'

    - Displaying stored procedureâ€™s source code
        - SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE stored_procedure_name
